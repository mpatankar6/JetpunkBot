## About

This is a bot to cheat on the [Jetpunk Countries of the World Quiz]("https://www.jetpunk.com/quizzes/how-many-countries-can-you-name"). In order to use, run the jar and immediately switch to the quiz's textbox. All the countries will be entered within 20 seconds.

## Note
Must be compiled and ran with jdk 17.0.3, check version with `javac -version` and `java -version`.<br>
This is important because java.locale has minor changes between versions, such as Macau changing to Macao from 17.0.2 to 17.0.3.

## Running
You can use the included `run.bat` file or use `java -jar --enable-preview JetpunkBot.jar` from the root directory.
